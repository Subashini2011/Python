Data Collection:
  Data collection is the process of gathering, measuring, and analyzing accurate data from a variety of relevant sources to find               answers to research problems, answer questions, evaluate outcomes, and forecast trends and probabilities. Our society is highly dependent   on data, which underscores the importance of collecting it.
 
Data Cleaning:
   Data cleaning (sometimes also known as data cleansing or data wrangling) is an important early step in the data analytics process. This      crucial exercise, which involves preparing and validating data, usually takes place before your core analysis.
   
Data Transformation:
   Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data.
  
Data wrangling:
   The data wrangling process can involve a variety of tasks. These include things like data collection, exploratory analysis, data cleansing, creating data structures, and storage. Data wrangling is time-consuming.
   
Data Visualization:
   Data visualization is defined as a graphical representation that contains the information and the data.
By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization techniques provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Inferential Statistics:
   Inferential Statistics makes inferences and predictions about extensive data by considering a sample data from the original data. It uses probability to reach conclusions. The process of “ inferring ” insights from a sample data is called “ Inferential Statistics.”
